42_Courses : So_Long (125%)

So_Long is a 2D game from 42 school projects 

i choose to simulate 90_s game Pac_man, but with a little different features,

here enemy is following you, textures are different and game is working on maps with specific characters(I have some examples of maps in 'maps' directory.

# this is how you can win

# this is how you can lose

# Arguments

so basically you run program name and the map for building the game on that map 
```
./so_long map.ber
```

but here you can add the difficulty level for map, that changes enemy movement speed

for example for easy level you have to run this command:
```
./so_long map.ber easy
```

this is for normal:
```
./so_long map.ber normal
```

for hard level:
```
./so_long map.ber hard
```

and you will never win with this level :)
```
./so_long map.ber impossible
```
